The SEWL site template uses the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to these [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) writing conventions.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

## Main file

The main file (labelled `style.scss`) should be the only Sass file from the whole code base not to begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.
