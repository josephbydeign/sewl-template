The SEWL site template uses the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticks to these [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es).

## Main file

The main file (called `style.scss`) is the only Sass file that dosen't begin with an underscore. This file should not contain anything but `@import` and comments.
